# Parallax

A Xamarin Forms page for hosting content in a page with an image that can be scrolled over.

This is based off the work of @jamesmontemagno available at http://motzcod.es/post/113970191382/android-parallax-made-easy

At the moment this only works for iOS and for simple views as the content - layouts (e.g. Grid, StackLayout) currently doesn't work.
